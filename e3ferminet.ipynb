The energy functional can then be computed by sampling points from $p(x) \\propto |\\psi(x)|^2$ to estimate the expectation value of $\\frac{\\hat H\\psi(x)}{\\psi(x)}$. The main difficulty remains in finding a good ansatz.\n","\n","One standard choice in VMC is to guess a wavefunction of the Slater-Jastrow type. This consists of a Slater determinant multiplied by a Jastrow factor (typically of the form $e^{J}$, with $J= \\sum_{ij} u_{ij}(|r_i - r_j|)$, i.e. a function of all pairwise distances to account for electron correlation. For example, the wavefunction ansatz PauliNet developed by Noe et al. uses a preliminary Hartree-Fock calculation as an input and expressiveness comes from the Jastrow factor and a backflow transformation, both represented as DNNs. However, one benefit of neural networks is that we don't need to be restricted to wavefunctions of this form, which have limitations such as being constrained to a finite basis set.\n","\n","In [this](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033429) paper, the authors used an ansatz parameterized by a neural network, and by performing gradient descent with $E[\\psi]$ as the loss function, they were able to accurately recover the ground state wavefunctions of a few small but challenging molecules. In this project, we will explore the potential of using an $E(3)$-equivariant neural network to parameterize the wavefunction. We will start by investigating single atoms. \n"],"metadata":{"id":"WK1mXON5QK8-"},"id":"WK1mXON5QK8-"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c7df8af5-7365-4955-95ce-86b98d16448f","metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"c7df8af5-7365-4955-95ce-86b98d16448f"},"source":["## Single atom wavefunction\n","Let's first study a single atom of atomic number $Z$.

Let $p(x) := |\\psi (x)|^2$ be the target distribution to sample from. Given a start point $x$, we generate a proposal point $x'$ from some proposal distribution $q(x; x')$, which could be, for example, a gaussian centered at $x'$. The proposal distribution is symmetric, that is to say $q(x;x') = q(x'; x)$. Then we calculate $a=\\min\\{1, p(x')/p(x)\\}$ and accept the proposal with probability $a$.
